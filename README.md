# GridDog

GridDog is a simple game inspired by simple curiosity. I wanted to experience working with a technology which allows users to interact with the web in an unconventional way (not through a mouse, keyboard or touch-screen). The goal is to guide Elmer, the GridDog, through the grid to his ball using spoken commands before the time runs out.
